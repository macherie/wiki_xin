====== BSS ======

BSS stands for Basic Service Set. The coverage of an access point is called a BSS. 

====== cfg80211 ======

Kernel side of configuration management for wireless devices. nl80211 is the User-space side of configuration management for wireless devices.

Works together with FullMAC-drivers and also with mac80211-based drivers. 

====== FullMAC ======

FullMAC is a term used to describe a type of wireless card where the MLME is managed in hardware. You would not use mac80211 to write a FullMAC wireless driver. 

====== IBSS ======

IBSS stands for Independent Basic Service Set. Its basically Ad-Hoc mode. See Independent Basic Service Set

====== Information Element ======

An Information Element (IE) is a part of management frames in the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN protocol. IEs are a device's way to transfer descriptive information about itself inside management frames. There are usually several IEs inside each such frame, and each is built of Type-length-value (TLVs). 

The common structure of an IE is as follows:


|   1   |    1   |     1-255       |
+-------+--------+-----------------+
| Type  | Length |     Data        |
+-------+--------+-----------------+

Whereas the vendor specific IE looks like this:

|   1   |    1   |          4        |    1-251   |
+-------+--------+-------------------+------------+
|  221  | Length |        OUI        |     Data   |
+-------+--------+-------------------+------------+

====== iw ======

iw is a new nl80211 based CLI configuration utility for wireless devices.

====== nl80211 ======

User-space side of configuration management for wireless devices. It is a Netlink-based user-space protocol. cfg80211 is Kernel side of configuration management for wireless devices.

Several user-space applications are available which utilize nl80211. See Developer Docs for nl80211. 

====== mac80211 ======

A driver API for SoftMAC WNICs. See Developer Docs for mac80211.

See also SoftMAC.

====== MAC ======

A WNIC works on both, Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model. MAC is a sub-layer for Layer2. Media Access Control

====== MLME ======

MLME Stands for Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer Management Entity. MLME is the management entity where the Physical layer (PHY) MAC state machines reside. Examples of states a MLME may assist in reaching:

    Authenticate
    Deauthenticate
    Associate
    Disassociate
    Reassociate
    Beacon
    Probe
    Timing Synchronization Function (TSF) 

mac80211's MLME management implementation is currently handled by net/mac80211/ieee80211_sta.c. This handles only the STA MLME

====== PHY ======

A WNIC works on both, Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model. PHY is abbreviation for physical-layer controller and refers to the hardware components of the WNIC, that are responsible for creating/producing the em waves conforming to the standards specified in the responsible standard, e.g. IEEE 802.11a.

See PHY and also Physical layer.

====== SoftMAC ======

SoftMAC is a term used to describe a type of WNIC where the MLME is expected to be managed in software. mac80211 is a driver API for SoftMAC WNIC, for example. 
====== SSID ======

SSID stands for Service Set IDentifier. The SSID is a code attached to all packets on a wireless network to identify each packet as part of that network. The code consists of a string of 1-32 octets (usually represented as case sensitive alphanumeric characters).

====== Station (STA) ======

Station (or STA) is the generic term for a device with a radio that can communicate with other stations in a wireless network. Common forms of a station are access points (AP), computers, or phones.

====== WE ======

WE stands for Wireless-Extensions - the old driver API and user <�"> kernel communication transport. Obsoleted by #cfg80211

====== WEXT ======

WEXT stands for Wireless-Extensions - the old driver API and user <�"> kernel communication transport. Obsoleted by #cfg80211

====== WIPHY ======

Wireless PHY.

====== WNIC ======

The Wireless Network Interface Controller always refers to the hardware performing the functionality described in the standards family, i.e. IEEE 802.11. This can be an entire PCB (e.g. a mini PCIe wireless card), a single Chip or the functionality can even be integrated into a SoC.
