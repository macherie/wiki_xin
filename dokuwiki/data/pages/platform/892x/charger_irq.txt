====== PMU charger irq 定义 ======

atc_done_irq: auto trickle charging completed successfully

chg_failed_irq: auto charging has failed Maximum fast charging time exceeded without ever reaching termination current

trkl_chg_on_irq: Interrupt is high when linear trickle charger is on during software controlled charging

atc_failed_irq: auto trickle charging failed

fast_chg_on_irq: charger is fast charging

chg_done_irq: auto charging has completed successfully

chgwdog_irq: Charger watchdog timer expired

state_change_irq: charger state machine has changed states

chg_gone_irq: Charger Removal was detected

dcin_valid_irq: dc in charge path is valid

dcin_uv_irq: Dc input charge path under-voltage

dcin_ov_irq: dc input charge path over-voltage

usbin_valid_irq: usb in charge path is valid

usbin_uv_irq: usb input charge path under-voltage

usbin_ov_irq: usb input charge path over-voltage

coarse_det_low: Generated if both DC path and USB path input voltages are less then the coarse detect falling threshold (~0.7 V) for at least 1 second

bat_inserted_irq: Battery inserted indicator

bat_removed_irq: Battery removed indicator

bat_temp_ok_irq: battery thermistor monitor is enabled and temperature is OK charging ( > 0 °C) or too hot for charging ( < 40 °C )

bat_temp_too_cold_irq: battery thermistor monitor is enabled and temperature is too cold for charging ( < 0 °C)

bat_temp_too_hot_irq: battery thermistor monitor is enabled and temperature is too hot for charging ( > 40 °C )

loop_change_irq: Interrupt is generated when the SMBC buck transitions between control loops (VDD / IBAT / IUSB / VIN). Loop status can be read from test register.

buck_vdd_loop_irq: Interrupts when SMBC buck transitions to voltage regulation loop. Can be used by software that needs to begin monitoring for end-of-charge, if current-based EoC is not used.

vbatdet_low_irq: VBAT < VBATDET setting as measured by VBATDET comparator

vbatdet_high_irq: VBATDET threshold reached : 1 = VBAT reached the top-off threshold setting (VBATDET register setting). Pulse charging begins (if enabled).

vreg_ov_irq: Generated if SMBC buck detects and overshoot voltage greater then 5% of the programmed VDD_MAX value.

vbat_ov_irq: Generated if VBAT > VBATDET for at least 1 us

batfet_irq: BATFET closed : 1 = Battery FET has been closed, i.e. BAT_FET_N pin = 0. Either it was programmed via SBI, or the charger 
automatically closed due to VDD collapse protection, or due to pulse charging.

overtemp_irq: Charger temperature exceeded PD_Temp_High2

vcp_irq: VDD collapse protection was triggered. 1 = VDD went below VBAT and PMIC turned on the battery FET to prevent a shutdown.

psi_irq: PMIC Serial Interface Interrupt for digital battery ID communication interface. Generated every time 32 PSI samples are transmitted or received
